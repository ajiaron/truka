            Should you and Truka LLC have a Dispute (as defined below),
            Truka LLC is committed to engaging with you to resolve it. Therefore, for any Dispute that arises
            between you and Truka LLC, the parties agree that they will first make a good faith effort to
            resolve it informally. This informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to
            commencing any formal proceeding in arbitration or small claims court. The parties agree that
            any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties
            engage in this process.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p className={v2styles.policyPageText}>
            For your Disputes with Truka LLC, you must first send your name, address, telephone number,
            email address, and sufficient information for Truka LLC to identify any transaction at issue; a
            detailed description of your Dispute; and the nature and basis of your claims and the relief
            sought, along with the calculation you used (the “Notice”) to the following email address:
            Support@reluevent.com. You and Truka LLC agree to negotiate in good faith about the Dispute,
            including through an informal and individualized telephone or video settlement conference if
            requested by Truka LLC. If either party to the Dispute is represented by counsel, that party’s
            counsel may participate, but the party also must personally appear at and participate in the
            settlement conference. This process should lead to resolution of the Dispute, but if the matter is
            not resolved within sixty (60) days after Truka LLC’s receipt of the complete written description
            detailed above, you and Truka LLC agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below. This
            time period will start to run upon receipt of the information referenced above. If the sufficiency
            of the Notice or compliance with this pre-dispute resolution process is at issue, either party may
            elect to have this issue decided by a court, and any formal dispute resolution proceeding shall
            be stayed pending resolution of the issue.

            <p className={v2styles.policyPageText}>
            You and Truka LLC agree that any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts,
            claims, or causes of action between you and the Company, or the Company&#39;s employees,
            agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, representatives, or assigns (“Dispute(s)”), shall be
            resolved through binding and confidential arbitration, except that you or the Company may elect
            to have a Dispute heard in small claims court if it qualifies for hearing by such a court, provided
            that an action in small claims may only seek individualized relief and so long as the action
            remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. If the
            limitations on a small claims court proceeding are deemed unenforceable for any reason, it
            shall be severed from this agreement and the parties may not elect to proceed in small claims
            court, and the dispute shall be heard in arbitration. In addition, each party retains the right to
            seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual
            or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party&#39;s copyrights, trademarks,
            trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. “Dispute” shall be interpreted broadly
            and shall also include all Disputes that arose before your agreement to these SMS Terms, and
            which arise after the termination of this agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, issues
            related to the scope, validity, and/or enforceability of this arbitration agreement are for a court
            to decide.

            There is no judge or jury in arbitration and arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited
            than rules applicable in court. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, APART FROM THE
            NARROW EXCEPTIONS ABOVE, YOU AND TRUKA LLC ARE EACH WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO
            SUE IN COURT, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO RECEIVE A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A

            THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO

            NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION

            ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT
            OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. IF A
            COURT DETERMINES THAT PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF MAY NOT BE WAIVED AND ALL
            APPEALS FROM THAT DECISION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED (OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE
            FINAL), THEN THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE PARTICULAR CLAIM FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE
            RELIEF SHALL BE SEVERED AND STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING
            CLAIMS. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE
            ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER) SHALL

            Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and shall
            be conducted by Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) pursuant to the JAMS
            Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) as modified by this arbitration
            agreement. The JAMS Rules, including instructions for bringing arbitration, are available on its
            website at www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration. If JAMS is unable or unwilling to
            administer a proceeding under this arbitration provision as written, the parties shall agree on a
            substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition
            a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a
            proceeding under this arbitration provision as written and applying the selected arbitration
            organization’s consumer rules. When initiating arbitration, you shall personally certify to Truka
            LLC and to JAMS that you are a party to this arbitration agreement and provide a copy or link to
            it. You shall also personally certify that you have complied with the pre-dispute resolution
            process detailed above. You agree that you shall personally participate, along with your counsel
            if represented, in the initial conference with the arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise.

            <p className={v2styles.policyPageText}>
            Truka LLC will pay its arbitration costs as required by JAMS rules, and in the event that you are
            able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of
            litigation, and you have complied with the pre-dispute resolution process outlined above, Truka
            LLC will pay as much of your arbitration filing and hearing fees as the arbitrator deems is
            necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of
            litigation. Each side shall pay their own attorneys&#39; fees, costs, and arbitration fees unless the
            arbitrator finds, among other grounds, (1) that either the substance of a claim or the relief
            sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth
            in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), or (2) the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party
            to be reimbursed its fees and litigation costs, and in such instances, the fees and costs awarded
            shall be determined by the arbitrator consistent with applicable law and with the JAMS Rules.
            The arbitrator may consider whether a party had previously offered full relief to the other party
            or whether the proceeding is part of multiple case filings. The provisions of Federal Rule of Civil
            Procedure 68 shall be applied by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be bound by these SMS
            Terms as any court would be. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned, detailed decision explaining
            the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall
            be binding only as to the parties. The arbitration may consider rulings in other arbitrations
            involving other claimants, but an arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving
            different claimants.

            <p className={v2styles.policyPageText}>
            The arbitration may be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person at a
            mutually agreed-upon location convenient for you. You agree to appear at an initial conference
            with the arbitrator and at any hearing, along with your counsel if you are represented. If fifty (50)
            or more claimants submit Notices raising similar claims and they are represented by the same
            or coordinated counsel, you understand and agree to the following provisions: (1) you agree that
            the adjudication of your Dispute may be delayed; (2) you agree that your counsel will negotiate
            in good faith with Truka LLC to determine a reasonable staged bellwether process involving a
            subset of demands not to exceed fifty (50) at a time, each of which shall be adjudicated on an
            individual basis; (3) only after each of the arbitrations that proceed are adjudicated or otherwise
            resolved shall the next set of staged proceedings commence; (4) your Dispute shall not be filed
            or considered properly filed in arbitration and filing fees shall not be due and owing until it is
            selected for inclusion in this continuously staged, reasonable bellwether process. This process
            shall continue until all the claimants’ claims are adjudicated or otherwise resolved. The statute
            of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for your claim from the time of initiation
            with JAMS until the time your Dispute is selected for a bellwether process, withdrawn, or
            otherwise resolved. A court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to
            enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against Truka LLC.
